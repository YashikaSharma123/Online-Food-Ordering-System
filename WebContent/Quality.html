<h1> ABOUT US</h1>

<p>
The  commitment to quality food and service goes back a long time,
 and the restaurant today announced the continued dedication to that pledge for years to come.
 
 recognized as the pizza restaurant which serves and delivers more pizzas than any 
other pizza restaurant in the world,will remove the following from its list of ingredients:
<ul>
<li> BHA/BHT from all meats by end of July 2016</li>
<li>Artificial preservatives from cheese by end of March 201</li>
<li>Antibiotics important to human medicine from chicken for its pizzas by end of March 2017</li>
</ul>
This comes roughly a year after Pizza Hut became the first national pizza restaurant to
 remove artificial flavors and colors from its core pizzas in May 2015.Pizza Hut has 
 removed 2.5 million pounds of salt from its ingredients over the last five years.
 
<q>We believe that Pizza Hut food shouldnt only taste great, but you should feel great 
about it, too,</q> said Jeff Fox,chief brand and concept officer, Pizza Hut. Our enhanced
 and expanded commitment to superior restaurant-quality food is the result of listening 
 closely to our customers, and they say that these are things that they do not want in
  their pizzas.
 
<q> Providing our customers with restaurant quality ingredients is something that has 
been at the core of Pizza Hut since the very first restaurant opened in Wichita 
58 years ago. It is so fundamental to our superior restaurant quality beliefs that
 we rarely feel the need to talk about it. That said, 58 years later, we are extremely 
proud to say that we still get our vegetables, our meats, our tomatoes, our flour,
 our cheese â€“ everything that makes a great pizza â€“ from top suppliers around the world.
 We are constantly working to lead the industry in this area and believe it is important
  to let customers know exactly where their food comes from and how it is made.</q>
 
 Pizza Hut has been pioneering the food and service experience in the pizza category
 since its inception. How they have done it has a lot to do with how they started â€“ 
 as a family. Pizza Hut has maintained â€“ intentionally â€“ a family-first business
 approach. This is especially true in the area of food. Pizza Hut has partnered
 with some of the same family farms in Kansas to grow the wheat for its dough
 since the late 1950s. Pizza Hut still harvests tomatoes to make its sauce from
 some of the same fields in California Central Valley that their founders did
 more than 50 years ago. In fact, most of the cheese used on Pizza Hut pizza
 today is made by the same family-run cheese supplier that did so many decades ago.
 
 The decisions made by our Founders involving relationships and partners have a lot 
 to do with why we are still the most loved pizza restaurant in the world, said Fox.
  <q>It comes from a fundamental truth about Pizza Hut: We started as a restaurant and
  maintain a restaurant-first mentality in everything we do. From how pizzas are 
  prepared, how customers are served and how the entire experience is presented.
  We strongly believe in our foundation of being a restaurant that serves people, 
  not just pizza, and that personal service is more important to our customers today
  than ever before. That why we are proudly making advancements in our food
  commitments and our dedication to serve.</q>
Why is this so important? Because relationships matter. Quality matters. And service cannot be compromised. To further demonstrate the significance of this, Pizza Hut has created a microsite dedicated to its food story at www.PizzaHut.com/RestaurantQuality. The site spotlights its ingredients, heritage, innovations and more. Customers can learn about where Pizza Hut ingredients come from and how the pizzas are made. For example, mushrooms go from farm to Pizza Hut pizza in as little as 48 hours, and sun-soaked tomatoes begin the process of becoming Pizza Hut sauce within approximately four hours of being picked from the vine.
In addition to these ingredient simplifications, Pizza Hut has already eliminated partially hydrogenated oils (also known as artificial trans fats) and MSG. Currently, 15 percent of the restaurantâ€™s pizzas have just one third of the daily recommended dietary allowance for sodium, and 20 percent of its pizzas will meet that criteria by 2020.
The pizza restaurant does not use any fillers in any of its meat toppings. Its Italian sausage is all natural and sourced from U.S. farmers, and its meatballs are free of any artificial colors, flavors or preservatives. Pizza Hut also does not add any sugar or oil to its pizza marinara sauce, and its cheese is made from 100 percent whole milk mozzarella.
Pizza Hut announced earlier this year plans to redesign up to 700 restaurants each year, with a goal of operating 8,000 restaurants in the United States by 2022 â€“ thatâ€™s a growth of 27 percent from the 6,400 restaurants Pizza Hut currently operates domestically. This redesign is intended to increase efficiency and convenience for team members and customers.
Pizza Hut is known around the world for its long heritage of breakthrough innovation in food and beyond, including the original PanÂ® Pizza, Stuffed Crust, Cheesy Bites, Crazy Cheesy Crust, and more. The pizza restaurant also has the worldâ€™s busiest website in the pizza category at www.pizzahut.com. Nearly 50 percent of the pizza restaurantâ€™s orders come through digital channels, of which 60 percent are via mobile device.

Creating Food We are Proud to Serve:
Pizza Hut is first and foremost a restaurant, founded by a two brothers in Wichita, Kansas, with a $600 loan from their mother. The idea itself was inspired by an article in The Saturday Evening Post that talked about this new pizza phenomenon. The brothers decided to open a pizza place and made sure all customers received great-tasting pizza and outstanding service. More than 58 years later, these tenets of delicious food and quality service still exist in our restaurants today. Watch the video â€œOur Quality Storyâ€ on YouTube.
When it comes to the three main ingredients that make up any quality pizza: tomatoes, cheese and flour for the dough, Pizza Hut makes quality ingredients a top priority. We have long-standing relationships with our suppliers for these critical ingredients that allow us to not only be first in line for high-quality ingredients, but also to make changes that have ripple effects across the industry. We have standardsâ€•from farm to fingersâ€•for everything that goes into our food, and we make sure our suppliers adhere to those standards every step of the way.
Creating food weâ€™re proud to serve is not only a mantra, its a way of life here at Pizza Hut. You can see it reflected in the work we do all the way from the culinary innovation team to the restaurant kitchens where our cooks are serving up pizzas day in and day out. This commitment is reflected at www.pizzahut.com/restaurantquality, where customers can go to learn more about the pizzas we serve and educate themselves on our restaurant-quality food. Weâ€™re even updating the look of our restaurants themselves with 700 new or remodeled locations planned for this year. And weâ€™re not done! As long as America wants pizza, we will be here making sure they get the best we have to offer.a
